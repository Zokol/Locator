Hardware: Arduino and DRA889TX or similar.

This is an small program that uses simple ASK-transmitter to broadcast an identifier and payload.
As an example, the payload can contain altitude and location data, or similar information to ease finding the transmitter.

I wrote this program to help locating my FPV Quadcopter in case of crashing it.
